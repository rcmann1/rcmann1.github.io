This paper seeks to investigate increase in individual’s reported disability by occupation over the course the Covid-19 pandemic.
   There is increasing evidence of Long Covid affecting a large percentage of the population in life-altering ways, at least while the Long Covid symptoms persist. This paper theorize  that over the past two years, Occupations with higher rates of in-person contact have more employees that have been disabled and attempts to measure those differences.
   I find that health support workers are most likely to see the greatest increase in likelihood of being disabled and of becoming disabled after the start of the pandemic. Similarly, I show  that occupations with higher levels of physical proximity to others increases the workers’ likelihood of being disabled and of becoming disabled after the start of the pandemic.
