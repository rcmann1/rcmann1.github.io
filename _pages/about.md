Hello! I am a first year PhD student in the Brooks School of Public Policy at Cornell University. I am interested in using applied microeconomics to study how discrimination impacts minority groups in the labor market, through both direct and indirect pathways (especially health) and how those pathways interact. I am currently working on a paperview that would provide an update of XXXX and XXXX using the BRFSS up to 2023 and the Household Pulse up to 2025.
