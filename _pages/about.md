I am a first year PhD student in the Brooks School of Public Policy at Cornell University. I am interested in using applied microeconomics to study how discrimination impacts minority groups in the labor market, through both direct and indirect pathways (especially health) and how those pathways interact. I am currently working on a paper that would provide an update of [Transgender status, gender identity, and socioeconomic outcomes in the United States](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0019793920902776?journalCode=ilra) and [Economic outcomes for transgender people and other gender minorities in the United States: First estimates from a nationally representative sample](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/soej.12594) using the BRFSS up to 2023 and the Household Pulse up to 2024. 

I have also dabbled in urban economics and urban history: as an intern at Brookings Metro I assisted Jenny Schuetz in writing blogs on climate resilience and housing, as an intern at the Council of Economic Advisers I assisted with the 2023 Economic Report of the President chapter on housing policy, as an intern at Federal Reserve of Philadelphia I assisted Allison Shertzer and Chris Severen in building longitudinal datasets related to urban economics, and as a student at UMBC, I wrote a history thesis on New Deal housing projects and then adapted it into a series of [public history articles](https://ggwash.org/contributors/rebecca-mann) for a local newspaper.
